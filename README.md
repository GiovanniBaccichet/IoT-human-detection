<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project 📺

The goal of this project is to analyze the traffic generated by a webcam call and, from such traffic, identify whether a person or only the background is recorded in the video. The problem is approached by a **Machine Learning** (ML) standpoint, acquiring data and creating a labelled dataset as a **ground truth**.
