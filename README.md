<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project 📺

The goal of this project is to analyze the traffic generated by a webcam call and, from such traffic, identify whether a person or only the background is recorded in the video. The problem is approached by a **Machine Learning** (ML) standpoint, acquiring data and creating a labelled dataset as a **ground truth**.

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap 🚸

- [X] Create README
- [ ] Address requirements of the project
- [ ] Acquire network traffic
  - [X] Choose tools to properly dump network traffic
  - [ ] Network traffic filtering
- [ ] Machine Learning algorithm choice
- [ ] Write **final report**

See the [open issues](https://github.com/GiovanniBaccichet/IoT-human-detection/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).
